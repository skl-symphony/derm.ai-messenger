## Objectives

- Develop an advanced skin disease classification system with high diagnostic accuracy

We live in a volatile time where the potential of health care access may become even more restricted in our country. As engineers, we are not politicians or law makers, so we wanted to create a solution that could equalize and provide basic medical diagnostics for everyone. Our hopes for this product is to provide a channel to empower doctors who want to do good by dedicating a small amount of their time diagnosing patients and helping us develop a smarter skin diesease classification system and provide a cost free solution to everyone for basic diagnostics.
